| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Volatility 3                 | Memory forensics (processes, network connections, browser artifacts). Can be run via CLI (Python) or with GUI frontends like **Volatility Workbench** for easier analysis. |
| Autopsy                      | Disk analysis and metadata extraction. GUI-based, user-friendly for browsing file system, extracting metadata, and generating reports.                                     |
| ChromeCacheView              | Extract browser cache and history.                                                                                                                                         |
| Python 3.11                  | Helper scripts for parsing outputs.                                                                                                                                        |
| Windows 10 RAM & Disk Images | Evidence for analysis.                                                                                                                                                     |
